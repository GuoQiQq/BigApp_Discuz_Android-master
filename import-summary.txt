ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* debug.keystore

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => amm_sdk_sample\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => amm_sdk_sample\src\main\assets
* libs\libammsdk.jar => amm_sdk_sample\libs\libammsdk.jar
* libs\wechat-sdk-android-with-mta-1.0.2.jar => amm_sdk_sample\libs\wechat-sdk-android-with-mta-1.0.2.jar
* res\ => amm_sdk_sample\src\main\res\
* src\ => amm_sdk_sample\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
